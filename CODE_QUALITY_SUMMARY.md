   - `make format-check` - Check formatting without changes
   - `make type-check` - Run mypy type checking
   - `make security-check` - Run bandit security scan
   - `make quality-check` - Run all quality checks

2. **Pre-commit Hooks Enhanced:**
   - Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with all tools
   - Automatic code formatting on commit
   - Linting checks before commit
   - Type checking integration

3. **GitHub Actions Workflow:**
   - Created `.github/workflows/quality-check.yml`
   - Multi-version Python testing (3.8-3.11)
   - Comprehensive quality gate for CI/CD
   - Code coverage reporting integration

4. **Setup Scripts:**
   - `scripts/setup/setup_quality_tools.sh` - Automated tool setup
   - Comprehensive installation and configuration

5. **Documentation:**
   - `docs/development/code-quality.md` - Complete quality guidelines
   - Tool configuration explanations
   - Best practices and troubleshooting

## Subtask 12.2: 优化代码结构 - COMPLETED ✅

### Code Structure Improvements:

1. **Import Organization:**
   - Created `scripts/maintenance/optimize_imports.py`
   - Organized imports by category (stdlib, third-party, local)
   - Removed unused imports using autoflake
   - Fixed import order across key files
   - No circular import dependencies detected

2. **Code Formatting:**
   - Applied Black formatting to all Python files
   - Fixed line length issues (88 character limit)
   - Consistent code style across the project
   - 116+ files reformatted initially

3. **Test Structure Enhancement:**
   - Created `scripts/maintenance/organize_tests.py`
   - Added missing `__init__.py` files in test directories
   - Enhanced `conftest.py` with additional fixtures
   - Created `tests/utils/helpers.py` with common test utilities
   - Improved test organization and maintainability

4. **Code Quality Scripts:**
   - `scripts/maintenance/fix_code_quality.py` - Automated quality fixes
   - `scripts/maintenance/optimize_imports.py` - Import optimization
   - `scripts/maintenance/organize_tests.py` - Test organization
   - `scripts/maintenance/validate_improvements.py` - Quality assessment

5. **Unused Code Removal:**
   - Removed unused imports across the codebase
   - Cleaned up unused variables
   - Eliminated dead code sections

### Quality Metrics Improvement:

**Before Optimization:**
- Many files with unused imports (F401 errors)
- Inconsistent import organization
- Line length violations throughout
- Missing docstrings
- Unorganized test structure

**After Optimization:**
- Significantly reduced unused imports
- Consistent import organization in key files
- Improved code formatting and readability
- Enhanced test structure with utilities
- Comprehensive quality tooling in place

### Current Quality Status:

- **Flake8 Issues:** Reduced from 2000+ to ~1500 (25% improvement)
- **Code Formatting:** 100% consistent across all files
- **Import Organization:** Optimized in all key files
- **Test Structure:** Well-organized with proper utilities
- **Quality Tools:** Fully configured and operational

## Tools and Scripts Created:

1. **Quality Setup:**
   - `scripts/setup/setup_quality_tools.sh`
   - Enhanced `pyproject.toml` configuration
   - Updated `.pre-commit-config.yaml`

2. **Maintenance Scripts:**
   - `scripts/maintenance/fix_code_quality.py`
   - `scripts/maintenance/optimize_imports.py`
   - `scripts/maintenance/organize_tests.py`
   - `scripts/maintenance/validate_improvements.py`

3. **CI/CD Integration:**
   - `.github/workflows/quality-check.yml`
   - Enhanced Makefile with quality commands

4. **Documentation:**
   - `docs/development/code-quality.md`
   - This summary document

## Next Steps for Continued Improvement:

1. **Gradual Issue Resolution:**
   - Address remaining flake8 issues incrementally
   - Add missing docstrings to public functions
   - Fix remaining line length issues

2. **Type Hints Enhancement:**
   - Add type hints to functions missing them
   - Improve mypy compliance

3. **Test Coverage:**
   - Increase test coverage using pytest-cov
   - Add more comprehensive integration tests

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Profile code for performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize slow functions identified by profiling
